   abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic offers an unprecedented opportunity to advance research on how various corporate governance mechanisms shape firms’ decision-making, survival and success. In the short term, corporate governance research could pinpoint which mechanisms in place before the pandemic (e.g., ownership structure, board attributes, executive compensation) will shape corporate responses, thus affecting firms’ survival in the post-pandemic period. In the long term, the crisis will trigger structural changes in governance mechanisms to enable firms to either prevent or respond to the occurrences of potentially similar events. In the reminder of this essay, we will first discuss the peculiar nature of the recent crisis in relation to other recent crises. Then, we will analyse the impact of Covid-19 on five key areas in the field of corporate governance (i.e., corporate purpose, ownership structure, board of directors, executive compensation and accountability) and, for each of them, we will suggest a series of research questions that contribute to redirecting and advancing the domain.},

   abstract = {Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: Does corporate governance explain US bank performance during the period leading up to the financial crisis? We adopt the factor structure by Larcker, Richardson, and Tuna (2007) to measure multiple dimensions of corporate governance for 236 public commercial banks. Research Findings/Insights: Findings reveal corporate governance factors explain financial performance better than loan quality. We find strong support for a negative association between leverage and both financial performance and loan quality. CEO duality is negatively associated with financial performance. The extent of executive incentive pay is positively associated with financial performance but exhibits a negative association with loan quality in the long-run. We find a concave relationship between financial performance and both board size and average director age. We provide weak evidence of an association of anti-takeover devices, board meeting frequency, and affiliated nature of committees with financial performance. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We apply agency theory to the banking industry and expect that the governance-performance linkage might differ due to the unique regulatory and business environment. Results extend Larcker et al. (2007), especially regarding the concave relationship between board size and performance, and the role of leverage. Given the lack of support for our agency theory predictions, we suggest that alternative theories are needed to understand the performance implications of corporate governance at banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications: We offer contributions to regulators, especially for ongoing financial reforms of capital requirements and executive compensation. Specifically, we show a consistent negative association between leverage and performance, which supports the current debate on Tier I capital limits for banks. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Using data from 73 listed companies in the period 2007-2012 (the global financial crisis), we find that (1) board size presents a non-linear relationship with excessive total directors' remuneration during the crisis period; (2) other board characteristics (board independence, duality and directors' ownership) do not show a significant relationship with excessive directors' remuneration; and (3) voluntary transparency on directors' remuneration significantly contributes to controlling excessive total directors' remuneration, which contributes to the long-term sustainability of the firm. The results of this study provide good reasons to take into account the effect of corporate governance characteristics and transparency on the remuneration excesses committed during the global financial crisis.},

We find that firms announcing a CEO pay cut are more likely to announce news that has a negative impact on their stakeholders, suggesting that pay cut announcements were used to alleviate stakeholder pressure. We also document that the pay cut announcements are associated with lower CEO salary but not total pay. In fact, our results suggest that pay cut announcements were symbolic, whereby salary cuts were substituted with increases in cash bonuses. Furthermore, we find a lower rate of shareholder dissent votes if a firm announced a pay cut. However, this effect is reduced if the CEO received higher total pay. Finally, we document higher shareholder dissent votes if a firm received government subsidies and paid higher CEO compensation or increased dividends. This suggests that shareholders do not prioritise their immediate financial interests and hold managers accountable for actions perceived negatively by the public.},

The pandemic has also threatened the survival of the firms, which has drawn the attention of policymakers and corporate governance practitioners around the world. In this study, we focus on how corporate governance practices can help firms to survive during COVID-19 crisis. For this purpose, we take insights from prior crises by reviewing leading business journals articles and identify key corporate governance mechanisms that could potentially be effective in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Our review of a large body of literature highlights several governance mechanisms that may help firms to cope with COVID-19 crisis. These governance attributes include risk management committees, board diversity, independent directors, foreign investors, institutional ownership, ownership concentration, CEO's dual roles, block ownership, and family ownership. We provide several policy implications after reviewing the corporate governance literature. Our review illustrates that firms may be subject to at least one of the identified governance mechanisms and they may learn how these governance attributes can be effective in the COVID-19 crisis. Our review illustrates that independent risk management committees, institutional ownership, board independence, blockholders, and family ownership are some of the essential and effective governance mechanisms compared to other governance attributes during COVID-19 crisis.},

In the context of the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC), we examine how CEO greed impacts firms’ stance toward corporate social responsibility (CSR) prior to the onset of the GFC and how this, in turn, shapes firms’ fate during and after the GFC. We argue that CEO greed will be negatively associated with CSR, because in their unbridled pursuit of personal wealth, greedy CEOs are more likely to exhibit myopic behaviors and neglect investment in CSR. We also adopt a person-pay interactionist logic to theorize that the willingness of greedy executives to invest in CSR will be especially sensitive to different types of pay instruments. Next, we build on recent findings from research on CSR that suggest that stakeholder engagement is a defining feature of resilient organizations. We expect that, due to low CSR investment, firms led by greedy CEOs will experience greater losses in the short run and will take longer time to recover from the 2008 GFC. For a sample of 301 CEOs of public U.S. organizations, we analyzed the stock prices and found general support for our hypotheses.},

What are the themes in CG in the COVID-19 era? and What are key areas of future research on CG and COVID-19? Design/methodology/approach: The authors attempted a systematic literature review of 62 studies published in 2020. The authors used four criteria to identify characteristics of the literature on CG and COVID-19 and three criteria to identify key themes in the literature addressing CG and the pandemic. The authors analyzed answers to the above research questions and proposals from studies reviewed to guide future research. Findings: CG in the context of COVID-19 has been studied mostly in developed countries and within a theoretical framework. As accounting data are insufficient, more research is required in all countries (developed, emerging and other). Further, there are no conclusive results regarding the relevance of ESG and CSR to financial performance. Future research should use additional methodologies and data sources to fully explain the impact of COVID-19 on CG. Practical implications: Practitioners and policymakers could benefit from the study, as the authors present key challenges to CG for the present and the future. Originality/value: This study is the first to provide a systematic literature review on CG during the COVID-19 pandemic and presents current trends, challenges and avenues for future research.},

P4S has been developed after reviewing the literature and obtaining insights from the compensation consultants in Switzerland. It is also a useful tool in COVID-19 and will be for future crises. As a second finding, this theory-adaptation-based conceptual and commentary paper criticizes the conventional executive compensation structure and introduces the business lessons learned from the COVID-19 crisis. As a contribution to both the literature and practice, this research advances the novel knowledge in the field by conceptualizing a reliable and scientific framework and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the four methods of the P4S framework. During COVID-19, environmental, social, and governance (ESG) based performances and compensation schemes have gained more importance.

Unexpectedly faced with significant changes in operating environments, some companies decided to suspend shareholder dividend payments. In normal circumstances, this would be interpreted as a very negative event and shareholders could be expected to respond adversely at the annual meeting. However, we investigate whether CEOs were able to maintain shareholder support by offering a previously unheard of response of “sharing the pain”, committing to cut their own pay following a dividend suspension. At issue is whether investors acted as if they updated their inferences using the new voluntary pay-cut decision to infer the extent to which the CEOs underlying personality type was well matched to crisis management.

   abstract = {Purpose: The main aim of this study is to empirically investigate the relationship between executive compensation, inequality, and corporate governance, thus filling a gap in extant literature. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used calculated the salary Gini (s-Gini) and governance indices (G-index) for companies in the sample and these were used as proxies for inequality and corporate governance respectively. The dataset is panel in nature. It comprises 46 conveniently selected largest JSE listed companies (by market capitalisation). A 2-step system GMM was used to determine if s-Gini and G-index were channels through which executive compensation could influence company performance. While considering a dynamic specification, the GMM estimator addressed possible endogeneity bias. GMM estimation method addressed potential over or underestimation of the relationship between company performance and executive compensation because it was considered more efficient on shorter panels. GMM analysis on companies listed on the JSE Top40 index was from 2008 to 2020. Overall, the methodology and analysis employed provide valuable insights into the complexities between executive compensation, inequality, corporate governance, and company performance, shedding light on important factors that can influence company's performance. Findings: Results indicated that as executive compensation improved, company performance deteriorated. Furthermore, varied impact of inequality on performance measures were recorded. The observation was that inequality influenced performance in diverse ways. This accentuated the convoluted nature of this relationship. The study also established that both inequality and corporate governance are channels through which executive remuneration affects performance. Additionally, a positive nexus between governance and net profit margin was discovered. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that: higher executive pay does not always yield better company performance; the effects of executive pay on performance are mediated by the level of inequality within the company and the quality of corporate governance practices; good corporate governance practices can enhance financial performance. It is recommended that companies should prioritise espousal of sound corporate governance practices because they have positive influence on performance. Moreover, diligent attention must be given to how executive compensation is configured. Poorly designed compensation packages erode company value. Conversely, properly structured ones may enhance performance and successively improve company value. This study is focused solely on the Top40 largest listed companies in South Africa. The findings may not be generalisable to all listed entities, as there could be variations in the relationship between executive compensation, inequality, and corporate governance across companies of different sizes. By concentrating on the largest entities, the study may gloss over nuances that exist in smaller companies. However, it is important to state that the insights gained from this research are still valuable and can provide useful guidance to policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders in understanding the interaction of the variables examined within the context of larger firms. Future research should consider expanding the sample to include a broader range of listed entities to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships across the entire corporate landscape. Originality/value: This study contributes to research gap highlighted by Core et al. (1999), Morais et al. (2013) and Enderle (2018) regarding the limited literature on income inequality within companies and strategies to mitigate such disparities. By incorporating income inequality as a key factor rarely explored in dialogues on executive compensation and performance, we contribute to knowledge in this field. Furthermore, the study sheds light on the interplay between executive compensation, corporate governance, and inequality as catalysts that influence company performance. To progress the discourse, future studies should investigate this phenomenon within the context of a pandemic, providing valuable insights to enhance the resilience of companies.},
